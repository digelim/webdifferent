            <div>
                <p>We wanted to do something special for this project so we looked into new techniques and trends for the UX/UI. These included a fullscreen grid-style menu system and cutting-edge parallax animation, all of which was incorporated within an editorial style layout.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The project case studies were also a big focus for us, so we designed a bespoke component that was a card-based, with draggable navigation. As the site is built in React technology, the user is able to journey through the portfolio without it feeling like you are loading new pages.</p>
                <br>
                <p>There were quite varied amounts of content for each project, therefore we approached this with a modular content management solution, where components can be toggled on or off making sure the layouts look great regardless of the content size. This meant projects with 30 images looked just as good as projects with 10. </p>
